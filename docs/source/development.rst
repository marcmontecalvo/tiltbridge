Notes for Developers
====================

Interested in extending TiltBridge or integrating it into your project? Awesome!

While I developed TiltBridge with a specific feature set in mind, the project is open source for a reason. There are
plenty of features that I haven't imagined which would make the project even better than it is. That said, before
developing a new feature and submitting a pull request, I strongly recommend reaching out. Although recent optimizations
have increased the available RAM and flash space on the ESP32, they remain at a premium and thus not all features may
be able to be merged in.
